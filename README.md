## TCP Communication

This Java code establishes a simple TCP communication between a client and a server. The client sends messages to the server, which in turn displays them. The communication continues until the client sends the message "stop". 

## Communication
- Enter messages in the client console. They will be sent to the server.
- The server receives and displays the messages until it receives "stop" from the client.
- To end the communication, type "stop" in the client console.

## Notes
- Ensure the server is running before starting the client.
- The server will keep running until it receives the "stop" message from the client or encounters an error.
- This code serves as a basic framework for understanding TCP socket communication in Java and can be extended for more complex applications
